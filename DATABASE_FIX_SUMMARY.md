# Database Connection Fix Summary

## Problem
Docker Compose wasn't providing DATABASE_URL to the application, causing Prisma migration failures.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Created `.env` file
- Added local environment variables for development
- Includes DATABASE_URL pointing to localhost PostgreSQL

### 2. Updated Backend Dockerfile
- Added dummy DATABASE_URL for Prisma client generation at build time
- Installed Prisma CLI in production image
- Created entrypoint script that runs migrations before starting

### 3. Enhanced Docker Compose
- Added health check for PostgreSQL
- Backend waits for PostgreSQL to be healthy before starting
- Added missing environment variables (JWT_SECRET, OPENAI_API_KEY)
- Added restart policy

### 4. Created Helper Scripts
- `docker-setup.sh`: Automated setup script
- `docker-entrypoint.sh`: Backend entrypoint with database readiness check

### 5. Updated Package Scripts
- Separated `start` and `start:migrate` commands
- Railway uses `start:migrate` for production
- Docker uses regular `start` (migrations handled by entrypoint)

## Usage

### Quick Start
```bash
./docker-setup.sh
```

### Manual Start
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Check Status
```bash
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs -f
```

## Important Notes
1. Update `.env` file with your actual OPENAI_API_KEY
2. PostgreSQL data persists in Docker volume
3. Services auto-restart on failure
4. Backend waits for database before running migrations
