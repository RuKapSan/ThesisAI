# Frontend Deployment Fix Summary

## What was fixed:
1. Created a new Dockerfile in `/frontend` that works when Railway uses `/frontend` as root directory
2. Added `railway.json` configuration for the frontend service
3. The original Dockerfile was renamed to `Dockerfile.from-root` (for reference)

## Next steps for Railway:
1. Go to your Railway project
2. Create a new service: "New Service" â†’ "GitHub Repo"
3. Select your repository
4. **Set Root Directory to: `/frontend`** (this is crucial!)
5. Add environment variables:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend-railway-url/api
   PORT=3000
   ```
6. Deploy!

The frontend will now build correctly with the updated Dockerfile that's designed for the `/frontend` context.
