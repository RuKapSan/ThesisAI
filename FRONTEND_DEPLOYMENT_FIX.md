# Frontend Deployment Fix Summary

## What was fixed:
1. Created a new Dockerfile in `/frontend` that works when Railway uses `/frontend` as root directory
2. Added `railway.json` configuration for the frontend service
3. Fixed COPY paths to match Next.js standalone build output structure
4. Handle empty public folder case by creating it

## Latest Fix (Build Error):
- Next.js standalone mode creates files at `.next/standalone/frontend/`
- Adjusted COPY commands to match this structure
- Fixed server.js path to `frontend/server.js`
- Created public directory to avoid COPY failures

## Next steps for Railway:
1. Go to your Railway project
2. Create a new service: "New Service" â†’ "GitHub Repo"
3. Select your repository
4. **Set Root Directory to: `/frontend`** (this is crucial!)
5. Add environment variables:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend-railway-url/api
   PORT=3000
   ```
6. Deploy!

The frontend will now build correctly with the updated Dockerfile that's designed for the `/frontend` context.
